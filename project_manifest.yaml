# CSAL Project Manifest
# Version: 1.0.0
# Last Updated: 2025-11-01

project:
  name: "Cognitive Systems Analogy Lab"
  acronym: "CSAL"
  version: "0.1.0-alpha"
  status: "Stage 1 - Foundational Mimicry"
  inception_date: "2025-11-01"
  license: "Apache-2.0"
  repository: "https://github.com/[username]/neural-process-model"

mission: |
  Bridge biological cognition and artificial intelligence by creating functional
  computational analogues of brain processes. Rather than simulating neurons literally,
  we translate cognitive principles into modular, composable AI architectures that
  replicate the emergent properties of human thought.

principles:
  - "Functional convergence over literal mimicry"
  - "Emergence over engineering"
  - "Modularity and composability"
  - "Evidence-based design"
  - "Interdisciplinary integration"
  - "Ethics first"
  - "Open science"

notes: |
  This manifest is a living document that tracks the overall state of the CSAL project.
  It should be updated regularly as milestones are completed, modules are implemented,
  and the project evolves.

  The manifest serves as:
  - A single source of truth for project status
  - A reference for AI tools and agents
  - A communication tool for stakeholders
  - A historical record of project evolution
