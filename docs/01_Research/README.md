# Research

## Purpose
This directory contains all research-related materials including literature reviews, neuroscience studies, cognitive psychology papers, and research methodologies.

## Contents
- Literature reviews (neuroscience, cognitive psychology, AI)
- Neuroscience reference materials
- Cognitive function studies
- Brain imaging analyses
- Comparative studies (brain vs. AI systems)
- Research methodologies
- Bibliography and citations

## AI Tool Usage
**When to use:** For evidence-based design decisions, scientific grounding, and research citations.

**Embedding priority:** HIGH - Source of scientific authority and inspiration.

**Chunking strategy:** By study/paper with abstract, findings, and implications as separate chunks.

**Metadata tags to include:**
- `document_type: research`
- `research_area: [neuroscience|psychology|ai|hybrid]`
- `cognitive_function: [specific function studied]`
- `brain_region: [if applicable]`
- `ai_implication: [how this informs AI design]`

## Document Standards
All research documents should:
1. Include proper citations (APA format)
2. Summarize key findings
3. Explain relevance to CSAL project
4. Identify AI/computational analogues
5. Note confidence levels and limitations
