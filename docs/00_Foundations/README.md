# Foundations

## Purpose
This directory contains the foundational documents that establish the theoretical, ethical, and conceptual basis for the Cognitive Systems Analogy Lab.

## Contents
- Research charters and mission statements
- Core principles and values
- Theoretical frameworks (predictive processing, global workspace theory, etc.)
- Ethical guidelines and safety protocols
- Philosophical foundations (consciousness, cognition, intelligence)
- Glossary and terminology

## AI Tool Usage
**When to use:** For understanding project philosophy, core principles, and ethical boundaries.

**Metadata tags to include:**
- `document_type: foundation`
- `principle: [specific principle name]`
- `domain: [ethics|theory|philosophy|values]`

## Document Standards
All foundation documents should:
1. Be written in clear, accessible language
2. Include historical context and motivation
3. Reference relevant neuroscience and AI literature
4. Define key terms and concepts
5. Explain implications for system design
